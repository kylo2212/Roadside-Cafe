Final Project for beginning level C++ class

This is the untouched code that was turned in on the final. I have not been back to this to update and correct the errors. I had some trouble with the arrays and candy bins when I wrote this. I also have a few other bugs I have yet to revisit and fix. These are now on my TODO list.
